      <p>I'm super duper happy right now. When I was younger, I lived with my grandma for a period of time. She would play these Disney Symphonies and other very old cartoons from the 30's and the late 80's. Usually when it's this late at night and I can't sleep (currently as I type this, it's 4:15 AM), I would go on youtube and watch these while I get caught up on homework and what not. But there was always these two "vintage" cartoons that were <b> SO </b> hard to find. It was a Betty Boop cartoon and one called Little Lulu.  </p>

     <p> I am so estatic finding the two cartoons. It makes me so nostalgic watching them. They're really old but they bring me back to simpler times. As cliche as it sounds. The cartoons are such a warm "home" feeling to me. I also watch this with Zoey until we fall asleep. And she's getting older...So those memories are so wonderful to me. </p>

     <p> I am so happy, I consider you watch this. Have a nice week! </p>
