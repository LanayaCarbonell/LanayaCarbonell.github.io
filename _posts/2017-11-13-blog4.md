I'm in Social Studies right now. I'm kinda bummed out Mr.Nieves is just a sub for us, I really got attached to him and also with Mrs.Campbell in English Honors. I have a test for her third period, that I REALLY don't want to do. But whatever it's cool. 

My break has been decent. I can't complain. I have been sick though, kinda bummed me out. But I like it when I'm sick, oddly. It gives me nostalgic feelings. My mom gets the same way too. My "aunt" (she's my cousin but she's older than my mom, so my "aunt") is very sad. My uncle can't leave from Cuba, it has made her devasted, it has made the whole family devasted. I hope she can find a job, if anything my mom and I come with open arms whenever she wants to stay with us. I love her very much, it sucks that I can't speak spanish. But it's kinda good I can UNDERSTAND it at least. 

Anyway, I don't want to leave on a bitter note, so one good thing that happened this week is that I saw my dad. I'm really happy for that, he's getting more grumpy, but whatever. Both of my parents are REALLY young. My dad is thirty two, and my mom just turned thirty or something. But my dad is really funny, I love him a whole lot. He's a really friendly person and I'm happy he's my dad, and I'm happy my mom is my mom. Would never replace them for the world!

SONG OF THE WEEK: The White Stripes- "Fell in Love With a Girl"
