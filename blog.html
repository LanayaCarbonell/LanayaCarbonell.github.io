    <h4> October 26, 2017</h4>
      <p> As of now, I guess I will be writing how my week has been for a couple of months. I will talk about the friends I have, the songs I like, the books I read, etc. Basically, an "All About Me". You can get to know about me and stuff. You can get to read my stories... This one is my favorite though: </p>
     <p> The word Potato may seem like a "funny" or even senseless word, but for me, that's the name of one of my best friends in this world. Potato was born on October 27, 2011. Her biological mother was named Willow and she was a stray that followed me home afterschool when it was raining A LOT. Of course, I did not want to leave her outside. She had no tag either and meowed at me, so I took her home and bam, that's how Willow and I met. </p> 
    <p> Willow got fat, and she ate a lot more. I was very confused, it seemed like someone put a bomb in her or something. Yet, on that lucky day of October 27, 2011 a liter of kittens were born. Two twins, two that looked like tigers and one that was the typical "beautiful grey" cat and... the smallest one, an all black kitten with a tiny, tiny tint of white on the tip top of the tail. Then, a week or two after, the most unusal thing happened. Willow left. </p> 
    <p> Now, I became the caretaker of five kittens. It wasn't easy, but they were super cute. My mom said I had to sell them, and tears soaked my face when I did. But, I secretly kept one kitten, the only one that the rest didn't pick, the black cat with the white tip top tail. I grew to love this baby. I loved her so much because every night she would sleep with me, every cold winters her fur grew, along with her love, and kept me warmer than before. And she's been sleeping by my side for exactly five years now. I love you so much Potato, happy birthday! </p>

    <p> Life has been treating me well, and teaching me lessons  which I appreciate. I love to watch Beetlejuice whenever I get sad, or possibly any Tim Burton Movie. It's like honey watching his creations. My dream since I was like six was to meet Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. I love Tim Burton because he has created so much ideas, especially Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Tim Burton is like a soft spot inside of me. He is my favorite creators and I think he will be forever, especially Beetlejuice (along with the cartoon). </p> 
    <p> This has also been the week of my friend and our 4 year annerversary. I thought being in a relationship as young as 13, it'll probably last like 5 months probably less. But two years ACTUALLY BEING TOGETHER, and four years knowing eachother, Zoey is not even half that age. It feels good being in a relationship, but eh. It has it's gray parts, just like with every relationship. Tolerence is key. And I don't like puppy love or "public love"; it took him a while to realize that there's always a time and a place. He is not my 'boyfriend', he's one of my best friends! And I'm really grateful for the blissful memories we have together and I'm hoping for so much more! </p>
